# agent-ready-skill

**Agentic Readiness Assessment** — a set of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) that evaluate how well a codebase is prepared for agentic coding (AI-assisted autonomous development).

Produces a quantitative score (0-100) across 8 weighted dimensions plus actionable guidance to improve readiness.

## Skills

| Skill | Command | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **agent-ready** | `/agent-ready` | Main entry point — routes to sub-commands, defaults to scan |
| **agent-ready-scan** | `/agent-ready-scan` | Full diagnostic analysis across 8 dimensions |
| **agent-ready-fix** | `/agent-ready-fix` | Auto-generate missing files to improve score |
| **agent-ready-report** | `/agent-ready-report` | Detailed report in `claudedocs/` with roadmap |
| **agent-ready-diff** | `/agent-ready-diff` | Delta comparison with previous assessment |

## Scoring Dimensions

| # | Dimension | Weight | What it evaluates |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Agent Instructions | 20 | CLAUDE.md, hierarchical rules, build/test/lint docs |
| 2 | Project Navigability | 18 | Structure clarity, index files, README, naming consistency |
| 3 | Testing & Validation | 16 | Test suite, documented commands, coverage, speed |
| 4 | CI/CD & Automation | 12 | Pipeline, linting, pre-commit hooks |
| 5 | Spec-Driven Workflow | 10 | Task specs, PRD, acceptance criteria, issue templates, ADR |
| 6 | Skills & Tooling | 8 | Local skills, Makefile, scripts, MCP config |
| 7 | Documentation & Comprehension | 8 | Linked docs, API docs, architecture, changelog |
| 8 | Claude-Specific | 8 | .claude/ directory, settings, hooks, MCP integration |

**Two analysis layers**:
- **Agnostic** (dimensions 1-5, max 76 pts) — valid for any AI coding agent
- **Claude-Specific** (dimensions 6-8, max 24 pts) — specific to Claude Code

**Score levels**: 🔴 0-30 Not Ready | 🟡 31-60 Partially Ready | 🟢 61-80 Ready | 🏆 81-100 Optimized

## Why These Dimensions?

Each dimension targets a specific aspect of agent effectiveness:

1. **Agent Instructions (20)** — The single most impactful factor. Without clear instructions, agents waste cycles guessing project conventions, build commands, and code style. Weight reflects that poor instructions cascade into every other dimension.

2. **Project Navigability (18)** — Agents navigate by reading files, not by memory. Clear structure, consistent naming, lock files for reproducible environments, and good READMEs reduce the search space and prevent agents from getting lost in deep or ambiguous directory trees.
   - *Environment Reproducibility*: Lock files and `.env.example` templates let agents set up identical environments without guessing dependency versions.

3. **Testing & Validation (16)** — Agents need fast, reliable feedback to know if their changes work. Test suites, documented commands, and good error messages in assertions are the agent's primary quality gate.
   - *Error Feedback Quality*: Bare `assert x` gives no signal on failure. Descriptive assertion messages and type checker configs give agents actionable diagnostics.

4. **CI/CD & Automation (12)** — Automated pipelines catch what agents miss. Linting, formatting, pre-commit hooks, governance files (CODEOWNERS, Dependabot), and security scanning provide guardrails that prevent agents from introducing regressions.
   - *Governance Guardrails*: CODEOWNERS ensures human review of critical paths. Dependabot/Renovate keeps dependencies current without agent intervention.

5. **Spec-Driven Workflow (10)** — Structured specs, templates, and acceptance criteria give agents unambiguous goals. Without them, agents must infer intent from vague descriptions, increasing error rates.

6. **Skills & Tooling (8)** — Custom skills, Makefiles, and MCP configurations extend agent capabilities. They encode project-specific workflows that would otherwise require manual instruction each session.

7. **Documentation & Comprehension (8)** — Linked docs, API documentation, and architecture overviews help agents understand the *why* behind code. Type annotations and manageable file sizes improve code comprehension for both agents and humans.
   - *Code Comprehension Signals*: Type annotations, reasonable file sizes (< 500 lines), and inline documentation help agents understand code semantics without running it.

8. **Claude-Specific (8)** — `.claude/` configuration, hooks, permissions, and MCP server integration are specific to Claude Code but can significantly improve the agent experience for Claude users.

## Usage

```
/agent-ready                              # scan current project (default)
/agent-ready scan                         # same as above
/agent-ready scan https://github.com/o/r  # scan a GitHub repo
/agent-ready fix                          # generate missing files
/agent-ready report                       # detailed report in claudedocs/
/agent-ready diff                         # compare with previous scan
```

## Installation

The skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. They live in `skills/` and are symlinked into `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code discovery.

For a fresh clone, recreate the symlinks:

```bash
cd /path/to/lince
for skill in agent-ready agent-ready-scan agent-ready-fix agent-ready-report agent-ready-diff; do
  ln -sf "$(pwd)/agent-ready-skill/skills/$skill" ".claude/skills/$skill"
done
```

```

## Compatibility

These skills are designed for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) but follow the open Agent Skills format. The scoring dimensions and analysis are agent-agnostic — only dimensions 6-8 are Claude-specific.
