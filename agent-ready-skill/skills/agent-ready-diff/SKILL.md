# Agent-Ready Diff — Delta Comparison

Compare the current project state against a previous agentic readiness assessment.

`$ARGUMENTS` may contain a path to a previous scores JSON file, otherwise use `claudedocs/agent-ready-scores.json`.

For the scoring reference, see `.claude/skills/agent-ready/references/scoring.md`.

## Step 1: Load Previous Scores

1. Read `claudedocs/agent-ready-scores.json` (or path from `$ARGUMENTS`) as the **previous** baseline
2. If not found: report that no previous assessment exists, suggest running `/agent-ready scan` first, and stop
3. Store the previous scores and timestamp

## Step 2: Archive & Rescan

1. Rename existing scores: `mv claudedocs/agent-ready-scores.json claudedocs/agent-ready-scores.prev.json`
2. Run a fresh full scan (invoke `/agent-ready-scan`) to generate **current** scores
3. Read the new `claudedocs/agent-ready-scores.json`

## Step 3: Compute Delta

For each dimension:
- `delta_weighted = current_weighted_score - previous_weighted_score`
- Direction: 📈 improved (> 0), 📉 regressed (< 0), ➡️ unchanged (= 0)

Also compute:
- Overall delta
- Agnostic layer delta
- Claude-specific layer delta

## Step 4: Display Results

## Step 5: Persist

- New scores already saved by the scan step
- Keep `agent-ready-scores.prev.json` for history
- The report file is also updated by the scan step

## Guidelines

- If this is the first-ever scan (no previous data), just run a normal scan and inform the user
- Be **specific** about what changed — don't just show numbers, explain what files were added/removed
- Track both improvements and regressions equally
- Suggest the highest-impact next improvement based on remaining gaps
