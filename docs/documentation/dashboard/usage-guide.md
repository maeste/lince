# Usage Guide

How to launch, navigate, and operate the LINCE Dashboard for multi-agent management inside Zellij.

## Launching

Start the dashboard with the `zd` shell alias (installed by `install.sh`):

```bash
zd
```

This opens Zellij with the dashboard layout. The plugin loads in a dedicated pane, ready to spawn and manage agents. If a `.lince-dashboard` state file exists in the current directory, saved agents are automatically restored.

For the tiled layout variant:

```bash
zellij --layout ~/.config/zellij/layouts/dashboard-tiled.kdl
```

## Keybindings

### Normal Mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` | Show inline name prompt, then spawn agent with that name |
| `N` (Shift+N) | Open the agent creation wizard |
| `r` | Rename the selected agent |
| `x` | Kill (stop) the selected agent and close its pane |
| `f` | Focus: show the selected agent's pane |
| `Enter` | Toggle detail panel for the selected agent |
| `h` / `Esc` | Hide: return focus from agent pane to dashboard |
| `Q` | Save agent state to `.lince-dashboard` and quit Zellij |
| `j` / `Down` | Select next agent in list |
| `Up` | Select previous agent in list |
| `]` | Focus next agent directly (without returning to dashboard) |
| `[` | Focus previous agent directly |
| `i` | Toggle info/detail panel |

### Inline Name Prompt

Pressing `n` shows a blue prompt bar at the bottom of the dashboard:

```
Name: my-agent          (default: agent-3)  [Enter] OK  [Esc] Cancel
```

- Type a custom name or press `Enter` to accept the default (`agent-N`).
- `Esc` cancels without spawning.
- Profile and project directory use config defaults. Use `N` (wizard) for full control.

### Wizard Mode

Pressing `N` (Shift+N) opens a multi-step wizard. Navigation keys:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Advance to the next step |
| `Backspace` | Go back to the previous step |
| `Esc` | Cancel the wizard |
| `j` / `k` | Move selection in list steps |

### Quick Select

Keys `1` through `9` focus the corresponding agent by its row number in the table. This is the fastest way to jump to a specific agent.

## Agent Creation Wizard

The wizard (`N`) walks through five steps to create a new agent.

**Step 1: Agent Type** -- Select from available agent types using `j`/`k`. Sandboxed agents are shown in green; unsandboxed agents are shown in red. This step is skipped if only one agent type is configured.

**Step 2: Agent Name** -- Text input for a custom name. Leave empty and press `Enter` to accept the auto-generated default (e.g. `agent-3`).

**Step 3: Profile** -- Conditional step, shown only when the selected agent type has profiles configured. Select a sandbox profile from the list (e.g. `vertex`, `anthropic`). Profiles control provider selection and environment variables.

**Step 4: Project Directory** -- Text input for the working directory path. Tab-completion is available. Defaults to the directory where `zd` was launched.

**Step 5: Confirm** -- Review all settings. Press `Enter` to create the agent, or `Backspace` to go back and change a setting.

## Agent Lifecycle

1. Press `n` (name prompt) or `N` (wizard) to spawn an agent.
2. The dashboard creates panes using the configured command for the selected agent type. Panes are hidden by default.
3. The agent appears in the table as **Starting** (cyan).
4. Status hooks report via Zellij pipe. The status updates to **Running** (green).
5. When the agent needs user input, the status shows **INPUT** (bold yellow).
6. When sub-agents are active, the status shows the count (e.g. `Running 2`).
7. Press `f` to show the agent's pane. Interact with the agent, then press `h` to hide it.
8. Press `Enter` to view detailed status (tokens, active tool, elapsed time).
9. Press `x` to kill the agent and close its pane. Status becomes **Stopped** (dim).

### Status Colors

| Status | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Starting | Cyan | Agent process is launching |
| Running | Green | Agent is actively working |
| Idle | Yellow | Agent finished a task cycle |
| INPUT | Bold yellow | Agent is waiting for user input |
| PERMISSION | Bold red | Agent needs permission approval |
| Stopped | Dim | Agent process has exited |
| Error | Red | An error occurred |

## Agent Detail Panel

Press `Enter` on any agent to toggle a detail panel below the table. It displays:

- **Agent type** -- display name with color. Red `[UNSANDBOXED]` warning if applicable.
- **Status** -- current status with color coding.
- **Profile** -- the sandbox profile in use (if any).
- **Project directory** -- the working directory path.
- **Token usage** -- input and output token counts with `k`/`M` suffixes.
- **Active tool** -- the tool name currently in use (reported during `PreToolUse` events).
- **Subagent count** -- number of running sub-agents, shown as `N` with a gear icon.
- **Started at** -- timestamp when the agent was spawned.
- **Last error** -- the most recent error message, if any.

Press `Enter` again to close the panel. `f` still focuses the agent pane.

## Swimlane Grouping

When agents span multiple project directories, the dashboard automatically groups them into swimlanes with colored headers:

```
 #  Agent Name             Status
 +-- ~/project/lince -----------------------------------
 1  CLA  agent-1 [fullstack]  Running
 2  CDX  agent-2              INPUT
 3  CLU! quick-test           Running        <-- unsandboxed
 +-- ~/project/other-app --------------------------------
 4  GEM  agent-3              Stopped
```

- Every row shows a 3-char type label (e.g. `CLA`, `CDX`, `GEM`) in the agent's configured color.
- Unsandboxed agents show a red `!` suffix (e.g. `CLU!`).
- Agents are grouped by `project_dir` and sorted by name within each group.
- Swimlane headers show shortened paths (`~` replaces `$HOME`).
- When all agents share the same directory, no headers are shown (flat list).
- Group names appear as dim suffixes when set: `agent-1 [web-stack]`.
- Navigation (`j`/`k`) moves through agents only. Headers are visual-only separators.

## Session Save and Restore

Press `Q` to save the current agent configuration and quit Zellij. On next launch from the same directory, agents are automatically re-spawned with their saved names, profiles, project directories, and token counts.

- State is saved to `.lince-dashboard` in the directory where `zd` was launched.
- Different directories maintain independent state. Launch from `~/project-a` and `~/project-b` for separate sessions.
- The state file is kept after restore, so an ungraceful quit (`Ctrl-Q`) still preserves the last saved state.
- If no `.lince-dashboard` file exists, the dashboard starts empty.

## Tiled Pane Layout

By default, agents spawn as floating overlay panes. Set `agent_layout = "tiled"` in `config.toml` to place agents as tiled panes in a fixed position within the Zellij layout grid.

Use the included tiled layout for a split view:

```bash
zellij --layout ~/.config/zellij/layouts/dashboard-tiled.kdl
```

```
+--------------------+----------------+
| Agent panes (60%)  | Dashboard (40%)|
| (spawned by plugin)| plugin         |
+--------------------+----------------+
```

In tiled mode:

- New agents appear as tiled panes. Zellij places them in the largest available area.
- Focus (`f` / `Enter`) switches terminal focus to the agent pane.
- No show/hide toggling -- tiled panes are always visible.
- `h` / `Esc` returns focus to the dashboard.

## Voice Relay

[VoxCode](https://github.com/RisorseArtificiali/voxcode) runs in the fixed bottom-left pane and provides voice-to-text input for agents. When configured with pipe mode, transcribed text flows through the dashboard to the active agent:

```
VoxCode --> zellij pipe --name "voxcode-text" --> Dashboard Plugin --> agent pane
```

To enable pipe mode, set in your VoxCode config:

```toml
[zellij]
use_pipe = true
```

When `use_pipe = false` (default), VoxCode uses the legacy focus-switch method, which works without the dashboard.

**Target priority** for voice relay:

1. Focused agent (if one is currently shown).
2. Selected agent (highlighted in the table).
3. No agent available -- error message in the command bar.

## Status Detection

### Pipe Mode (default)

Agents report status via `zellij pipe` using their configured `status_pipe_name`. This is the recommended method.

- **Claude Code** (`claude-status` pipe): Native hooks send rich status events -- idle, running, permission, tool usage, subagent start/stop, and token counts.
- **Codex** (`lince-status` pipe): Uses `lince-agent-wrapper` for lifecycle events. An optional Codex `notify` hook sends `idle` on turn completion.
- **Other agents** (`lince-status` pipe): Use `lince-agent-wrapper` which sends `start` and `stopped` lifecycle events.

```bash
# Claude Code native hook example:
zellij pipe --name "claude-status" --payload '{"agent_id":"agent-1","event":"idle"}'

# lince-agent-wrapper example:
zellij pipe --name "lince-status" --payload '{"agent_id":"agent-5","event":"start"}'
```

**Claude Code events**: `idle`, `running`, `permission`, `subagent_start`, `subagent_stop`.
Additional fields: `tool_name` (on `PreToolUse`), `subagent_type` (on subagent events).

**Codex events**: `start`, `idle`, `stopped`.

**Wrapper events**: `start`, `stopped`.

### File Mode (fallback)

Status files are written to `/tmp/lince-dashboard/{agent_id}.state`. The plugin polls every 2 seconds.

Set `status_method = "file"` in `config.toml` to use this mode. Use it only when pipe mode is unavailable.

## Sandbox Integration

For status reporting to work inside `agent-sandbox`, the sandbox must pass through Zellij environment variables. Add to your sandbox config (`~/.agent-sandbox/config.toml`):

```toml
[env]
passthrough = ["ZELLIJ", "ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME", "LINCE_AGENT_ID"]
```

Agent-specific environment variables (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY` for Codex) are set via the `env_vars` field in the agent type configuration and passed through automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Ctrl+Shift+C kills agent (Terminator + Zellij)

When running agents inside the dashboard on **Terminator**, pressing **Ctrl+Shift+C** to copy also delivers a SIGINT to the agent in the focused pane, interrupting it. The same key combo behaves correctly in Terminator without Zellij — the conflict only appears in the Terminator + Zellij combination.

**Fix**: remap Terminator's copy shortcut to a key that doesn't include Ctrl+C.

Option 1 — Edit `~/.config/terminator/config`:
```ini
[keybindings]
copy = <Primary>Insert
```
Restart Terminator. `Ctrl+Insert` will copy without sending SIGINT.

Option 2 — Via GUI: **Terminator → Preferences → Keybindings → copy_clipboard**, bind it to `Ctrl+Insert` or another shortcut that doesn't include Ctrl+C.
